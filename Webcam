Using Arduino IDE, I installed all the packages needed to connect the ESP32CAM and use it through this IDE. 

Follow the following steps in order:

1.- File > Preferences > Additional Boards MAnager URLs:
- We need the .json document that can be found on espressif (manufacturer of ESP32CAM) repository. So Arduino IDE
can download the packages needed to compile for the ESP32CAM:
                -https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_dev_index.json  

2.- Tools > Board "Arduino Uno" (in my case) > Boards Manager:
- Type "esp32" and install the board.

4.- Tools > Board "Arduino Uno" > "AI ThinkerESP32CAM"
           *CPU Frequency = 240Mhz
           *Flash Frequency = 40Mhz (The crystal of ESP32CAM works at 40MHz)
           *Flash mode = QIO
           *Port = (The port where the FTDI is connected)
.........................................................................................
3.- Now you are ready to use the ESP32CAM. First make the physical connection between devices:
-Take the ESP32CAM and the FTDI. Connect the transmission pin (UOT) of the ESP32CAM with the receptor pin (RX) of 
the FTDI, and the receptor pin (UOR) of the ESP32CAM with the transmission pin (TX) of the FTDI. This will allow 
communication between the ESP32CAM and the FTDI.

-Connect ground of the ESP32CAM to ground of the ESP32CAM, and power input (VCC) of the FTDI with 5V of the 
ESP32CAM. Remeber that you have two options 5 volts and 3.3 volts. The jumper of the FTDI has to be connecting the
center and 5V. Now they have energy to wake up from their sleep.

ESP32CAM    FTDI 
UOT         RX
UOR         TX
5V/3.3V     VCC
GND         GND
......................
4.- Let's upload the code:
-File > Examples > ESP32 > CAmera > CameraWebServer
           *In "Select camera model" select "#define CAMERA_MODEL_AI_THINKER" and comment the other.
           *Change "ssid" with the name of your internet and "password" with the password of your internet.
-Programming mode on the ESP32CAM:
           *Connect IO0 pin to ground (GND).
           *Hold reset button and click upload when you see "Connecting" hold off.
           
5.- Let's run the code:
-Open "Serial Monitor"
-Disconnect the bridge between IO0 and GND.
-Click "reset" button
-You will be given a http link and there is your "camera web server".
-Copy the http link and paste it in the browser.

PERFECT, NOW YOU ARE USING ESP32CAM.
